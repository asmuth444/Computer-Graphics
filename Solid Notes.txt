Wireframe => glutWire()
Solid => glutSolid()

for othographic projections
Teapot(size)
Cube(size)
Sphere(radius,no.of slices, no. of stacks)
Torus(iradius, oradius, no.of sides, no. of rings) Donut shaped
Cone(base, height, no. of slices, no. of stacks)

wireframes are filled with solid blocks.

Perspective projection:
gluPerspective(fovy,Aspect Ratio, Znear, Zfar)
gluLookAt((x,y,z)camera position,(x,y,z)centre of view,(x,y,z)up direction)
Either orthographic will happen or perspective will happen
